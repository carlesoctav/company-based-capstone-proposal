Why is this problem/project interesting for your team?
Enhancing discussion forum user-system interaction to be more human-like presents an NLP challenge that intrigues us to solve it.

What’s your group’s initial idea to work on this project?
We propose two features for the forum: tagging suggestions and semantic search.

tagging suggestions will automatically assign predefined tags (as a suggestion) to new discussions based on their title and description, improving visibility and aiding proper tagging for new users. 

Semantic search will retrieve discussions based on the similarity between the query and the contents, allowing users to find relevant discussions without the need for exact queries. Both features aim to enhance user experience on the forum and improve the accessibility and organization of the discussions for all users.

Does your team have unique solutions to be proposed?
The features we propose are essential for a discussion forum to have, yet still achievable within a one-month time span. Moreover, we will make use of the latest state-of-the-art (SOTA) technology, such as transformer-based models for our tagging suggestions and semantic model, While not as complex or costly as the GPT text generation model, which is expensive to train and fine-tune. Additionally, we will ensure the scalability of the system, making it easy to scale up in the future.


Based on your knowledge, what tools/IDE/Library will your team use to solve the problem?
Below is a list of the tools, IDEs, and libraries that we will be using (although this list is not exhaustive):
Wandb, Hugging Face, Tensorflow/pytorch, Docker, Label Studio, Gantry,  Gradio, kaggle/colabs (cloud gpu).

Based on your knowledge and explorations, what will your team need support for?
Discussion forum data (title and description), and search query data.
Mentors with expertise in natural language processing (NLP), particularly for Indonesian language
Access to cloud GPU resources
Note: This list is not exhaustive, and additional items may be needed.



Any other notes/remarks we should consider on your team’s application?
